This is a project where I work with React useState.
I have my components in a components folder and my pages in pages folder (only 1 page now).
I wanted to have app.tsx very clean so you will only see "ukRoyalFamily.tsx" there.
I took my components and props from previous guides (buttons and cards) and made a "favorite function" for the cards. When clicking on the heart on the cards it will be chosen as a favorite.
On my navbar you should se the number in the red circle change when you add something to your favorite.
It sounded simple in my head but I got confused very often but in the end I managed to make it work. 
The next thing would be to have a list over all your favorites.. but that's for later..
